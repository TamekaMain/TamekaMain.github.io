            <h2>Placement 1: Pymble Ladie's College</h2>
            <p> I have been able to gain a deeper understanding  on how I can apply my learnings of catering to different students aabilities into a lesson plan. I have been able to apply my knowledge of basic questioning and behavioural management in the classroom, hoping to furthermore improve this in future practicums</p>

        <section class="section">
            <h2>Placement 2: Pymble Ladie's College</h2>
            <p>I recognise the importance  of intergrating the syllabus into future work, planning and enhance  assessment development and reporting. I aim to seek more feedback to meet teaching standards and explore professional development outside my supervisor. Additionally I need to better utilise formative assessments to guide future learning.</p>

        <section class="section">
            <h2>Placement 3: Pennant Hills Highschool</h2>
            <p> I planned lessons to help meet diverse learning needs using school based data and will continue improving my teaching strategies for all learning styles. I worked closely with staff to design effective lessons and enjoyed participating in school activities to foster stronger connections. I created a saef and welcoming classroom environment and will continue to develop questioning techniques and seek more feedback. </p>
